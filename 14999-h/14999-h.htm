<p align=justify><b>Transcriber's Notes</b>:
This work was originally produced in 1630,
only 26 years after Cawdrey's first English dictionary and more
than a century before Johnson's. The spelling is, in many cases,
strange to modern standards and highly variable. I have noted a
small number of cases which would, I think, have been considered
absurd by the original author. These have been amended to a more
consonant form and marked as, for example,
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'observttion'. Ed.">observation</ins>,
where the
original may be seen by hovering the mouse cursor over the word;
all other spelling has been retained as the original. Some
apparently incorrect or missing punctuation has been corrected
silently. The reader should note that <b>e&#x0303;</b>,
<b>o&#x0303;</b> and <b>u&#x0303;</b> are used to imply
nasalization and should be read as indicating an omitted
'<b>m</b>' or '<b>n</b>' following the vowel. Words including
this have been marked as, for example,
<ins class="fixup" title="Read as 'from'. Ed.">fro&#x0303;</ins>,
where the recommended reading may
be seen by hovering the mouse cursor over the word. The letters
'<b>u</b>' and '<b>v</b>' are used largely interchangeably as also, though to a
lesser extent, '<b>i</b>' and '<b>j</b>'.--<b>ATB</b>.</p>

<br />
</div>
<br />
<p>Topographie is a particular description of some small quantity of
Land, such as Land measurers sett out in their plots.</p>

<p>Chorographie is a particular description of some Country, as of
England, France, or any shire or prouince in them: as in the
vsuall and ordinary mappe.</p>

<p>Geography is an art or science teaching vs the generall
description of the whole earth, of this especially wee are now to
speake of, and also Chorography as a part vnder it conteyned:
both, excellent parts of knowledge in them selues, and affoording
much profit and helpe in the vnderstanding of history &amp; other
things. The parts of Geography are two.</p>

<blockquote>
Generall, which treateth of the nature, qualities,
measure, with other generall properties of the earth.
<br />
Speciall, wherein the seuerall countrys and coasts of the
earth are deuided and described.
</blockquote>

<p>Of the generall in the first place, and more at large then of the
other, because it is more difficult, and hard to bee vnderstood,
and yet of necessary vse, for the vnderstanding of the other.
This generall tract may bee parted into fiue particular heads.</p>

<br />
<h4><i>Of certaine generall properties of the earth.</i></h4>
<br />
</div>
<br />
<p>In Geography when wee name the earth wee meane not the earth
taken seuerally by itselfe, without the seas and waters. But
vnder one name both are comprised, as they are now mingled one
with another and doe both together make vp one entire and round
body. Neither doe wee diue into the bowels of the earth, and
enter into consideration of the naturall qualities, which are in
the substance of Earth and water, as coldnes, drinesse moisture,
heauines, and the like, but wee looke only vpon the out side,
contemplating the greatnesse, scituation, distances, measuringe,
and other such affections which appeare in the superficies of it,
to the eyes of our bodies and mindes: These then of the earth and
water together, rules are to bee knowne,</p>
<ol id="chap2_">
<li id="chap2_1">
<p><i>The earth and the water doe make one globe, i.e., one round or
sphericall body.</i></p>

<p>The naturall place of the water is to bee aboue the earth, and
soe it was in the first creation of it, compassing, the earth
round aboute as appeares Genes. 1. 9. But for the vse of man and
all other liuing creatures, God made a separation of them
caussing the waters to sinke downe into huge hollow channells,
prepared to receaue it, that so the drie land might appeare aboue
it. Notwithstanding which separation, they doe both still remaine
together, not couering one another as at first, but intermingled
one with another, and that soe exactly as they now make but one
round body, whereas at first they made two. Here therfore are two
poynts to be proued, 1. That they are one globe. 2. that this one
is round.</p>
<ol id="chap2_1_">
<li id="chap2_1_1">
<p>They are one globe hauing the same Center or middle pointe, and
the same surface or conuexe superficies, which will appeare by
these reasons.</p>
<ol id="chap2_1_1_">
<li id="chap2_1_1_1">
<p>Common experience. Take a lumpe of earth and any quantity of
water, and let them both fall downe together vpon the earth from
some high place, wee see that in the
<ins class="fixup" title="Read as 'descent'. Ed.">desce&#x0303;t</ins>
they doe not
seuer, but keepe still together in on streight line, which could
not bee, if the earth and water were two seuerall round bodies
hauing seuerall centers. As for example suppose them to bee two
globes and let (<i>a</i>) bee the Center of the earth and (<i>b</i>) the
center of the water;
<ins class="fixup" title="Read as 'from'. Ed.">fro&#x0303;</ins>
(<i>c</i>) some high place aboue the earth
hurle downe earth and water, I say the earth will part from the
water in going downe and the earth will fall downe vpon (<i>d</i>) &amp;
the water vpon (<i>e</i>) but this is contrary to experience &amp; <i>ergo</i>
the supposition is false.</p>

</li>
<li id="chap2_1_1_2">
<p>The shadow which in Eclipses is cast vpon the Moone by the
earth and the water, is but one and not two, &amp; therefore the body
is so likewise. This will appeare in the proofe of the next
point, v. 2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li id="chap2_1_2">
<p><i>That both earth and water are one round body, not square,
long, hollow, of any other figure. This is proued by diuerse
reasons.</i></p>
<ol id="chap2_1_2_">
<li id="chap2_1_2_1">
<p>By Eclipses; when the earth, stands iust betweene the Sunne and
the Moone, then doth the shadow of the earth falling vpon the
Moone darken it wholy or in part. Now as is the fashion of the
shadow, such is the figure of the body, whence it falls, but the
shadow of the earth and water cast vpon the Moone is round, and
also one, therefore they are round and also one body.</p>

<p>By the orderly and successiue appearing of the starres, as men
trauile from North to South, or from South to North, by sea or
land. For as they goe by degrees, they discouer new starres,
which they saw not before, and loose the sight of them they did,
which could not bee if the earth were not round. As for example,
let (<i>X.O.R.</i>) the inward Circle bee the earth, (<i>Q.S.P.</i>) the
outward, the Heauen: they cannot see the starre (<i>S</i>) which dwell
vpon the earth in (<i>X</i>) but if they goe Northward vnto (<i>O</i>) they
may see it. If they goe farther to (<i>R</i>) they may see the starre
(<i>P</i>) but then they loose the sight of the starre (<i>Q</i>) which
being at (<i>X</i>) and (<i>O</i>) they might haue seene. Because, as it
appeares in the figure, the earth riseth vp round betweene (<i>R</i>)
and (<i>X</i>).</p>

<li id="chap2_1_2_3">
<p>By the orderly and successiue rising of the Sunne and starres,
and settinge of the same. Which appeare not at the same time to
all countryes, but vnto one after another. As for example, let
(<i>F.C.B.</i>) be the Circle of the earth, (<i>D.E.A.</i>) the Circle of
the heauen from East to west, let (<i>A</i>) bee the Sunne or a
starre. When the Sunne (<i>A</i>) is vp, and shines vpon them that
dwell in (<i>B</i>) hee is not risen to them that dwell in (<i>C</i>)
againe when hee is risen higher and is come to (<i>E</i>) and so
shines vpon those that dwell in (<i>C</i>) hee is not yet vp to them
that dwell in (<i>F</i>). Againe when hee setts in the West, in (<i>D</i>)
and so is out of sight to the inhabitants in (<i>B</i>) hee is yet vp
to them that dwell in (<i>C</i>) and (<i>F</i>). Which shews plainely the
earth is round.</p>

</li>
<li id="chap2_1_2_4">
<p>By the different obseruations of Eclipses. One and the same
Eclipse appearing sooner to the Easterly Nations then those that
lye farther west, which is caused by the bulke of the earth
swelling vp betweene. As for example.</p>

<p>Let (<i>X.O.</i>) bee the Circle of the earth, and the greater the
Circle of the heauen from East to West. Let (<i>P.Q.</i>) bee the body
of the Sunne, (<i>W.S.</i>) of the Moone in the eclipse by reason of
the earth betweene it and the Sunne. It is manifest that the
inhabitants in (<i>O</i>) shall see the eclipse before the inhabitants
in (<i>X</i>) by certaine houres, according as the distance betweene
(<i>X</i>) and (<i>O</i>) is more or lesse. They that dwell in (<i>O</i>) shall
see it in (<i>S</i>) they that dwell in (<i>X</i>) see it not till it come
to (<i>W</i>) a great deale higher.</p>

<li id="chap2_1_2_5">
<p>That the water is round besides the naturall weight and
moisture of it, which being apt to yeeld and runne abroad, will
not suffer some places to ly high, and some low, like hills, &amp;
dales, but though it be made rough and vneuen by tempest, doth
<ins class="fixup" title="Read as 'presently'. Ed.">prese&#x0303;tly</ins>
returne to their naturall smoothnesse and euennesse:
I say besides this: it is cleare by common experience; for if wee
stand on the land, and see a ship goe forth to sea, by degrees
wee loose the sight of it, first of the bulke then of the
mast, and all. So also one the other side they that are at sea by
degrees doe loose or gaine the sight of the Land: As for example.</p>

<p>Let (<i>A</i>) bee some steeple vpon the land (<i>B</i>) a shipp at sea: He
that stands at (<i>A</i>) shall by little and little loose the sight
of the ship, as shee goes out, &amp; gett sight of her as shee comes
in. Both first and last hee shall haue the sight of the top mast
(<i>B</i>) when hee sees nothing else. Because the sea riseth vp
betweene his sight and the ship.</p>

</div>
</li>
</ol>

<p>These reasons and experiments may suffice to proue the roundnesse
of the earth and water; which might bee farther demonstrated by
shewing the falshood of all other figures regular or irregular
that can be giuen vnto it; that it is neither square, nor
three-cornerd, nor Piramidall, nor conicall on Taperwise,
nor Cylindricall like a barley rowle, nor hollow like a dish,
nor of any other fashion, as some haue imagined it to bee of.
Wee come to this second rule.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li id="chap2_2">
<p><i>The tops of the highest hills, and the bottoms of the lowest
vallies although in seuerall places they make the earth vneven,
yet being compared to the vast greatnesse of the whole, doe not
at all hinder the roundnesse of it.</i></p>

<p>Among all Geometricall figures the sph&aelig;riall or the round is the
most perfect, and amongst all naturall bodies the heauen is the
most excellent. It was therefore good reason the most beautifull
body should haue the most perfect and exquisite shape. Exact
roundnesse then is not found in any body, but the Heauens; the
earth is round as was showed before, but not precisely, with out
all roughnes and in&aelig;quality of its surface. There are hills like
warts and vallies like wrinkels in a mans body; and that both for
ornament and vse. Yet is there such vnformity in this varietie,
as that there is no notable and sensible in&aelig;quality made in the
earth by Hills and vallies. No more then if you should lay a fly
vpon a smooth Cartwheele, or a pinnes head vpon a greate globe.
Now that this is soe appeares by Sense and Reason. By Sense thus,
If wee stand on a hill or in a plaine, when wee may discrie the
country round about 15. or 20. miles; wee may behold the brim or
edge of the earth round about vs to bee in a manner euen and
streight, euen there, where the country is very hilly, and full
of mountaines. So that a farre of their height makes but a little
alteration and difference from the plaine Countreys, when wee
behold all togeather a farre of: though when wee come neere, the
alteration seemes more sensible.</p>

<p>By reason thus, the thicknesse of halfe the earth is (as shall be
shewed) about 4000 miles, now the plumb height of the highest
mountaines is not accounted aboue a mile and a halfe, or two
miles at the most. Now betweene two miles and foure thousand,
there is no sensible proportion, and a line that is foure
thousand and two miles long, will not seeme sensibly longer then
that which is foure thousand; as for example. Let (<i>O</i>) be the
center of the earth, (<i>XW</i>) a part of the circle of the earth
which runneth by the bottomes of the hils and superficies of
champion and even plaines (<i>WO</i>) or (<i>XO</i>) is the semidiamiter or
halfe the depth of the earth. (<i>S</i>) is a hill rising vp aboue
that plaine of the earth, (<i>WS</i>) is the plumb height of the hill.
I say that (<i>WS</i>) doth not sensibly alter the length of the line
(<i>OW</i>); for (<i>WS</i>) is but two miles. (<i>WO</i>) 4000 miles, and two
to 4000 alters not much more, then the breadth of a pinne to the
length of a pearch. So a line drawne from (<i>O</i>) the center to
(<i>S</i>) the top of the hill, is in a manner all one with a line
drawen to (<i>W</i>) the bottome of the hill.</p>

<div align=center class="center">
<img src="images/013diagm.png" width="432" height="901"

</div>

<p>The third rule.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap2_3">
<p><i>The earth resteth immovable in the very midst of the whole
earth.</i></p>

<p>Two points are here to be demonstrated. <i>First that the earth
standeth exactly in the midst of the World. Secondly that it is
immoveable.</i></p>
<ol id="chap2_3_">
<li id="chap2_3_1">
<p>The former is proved by these reasons.</p>
<ol id="chap2_3_1_">
<li id="chap2_3_1_1">
<p>The naturall heavinesse of the earth and water is such, as they
will never cease mooving downewards till they come to the lowest
place; Now the center or middle point of the world is the lowest
place, and <i>ergo</i> they must needs moue thither, as for example.</p>

<p>Let (<i>O</i>) be the center of the world, (<i>CDE</i>) the heauens: it is
manifest that the lowest place from the heauens on all sides is
(<i>O</i>). Ssuppose the earth to be in (<i>A</i>) or in (<i>B</i>) some where
out of the center, I say it is not possible (vnlesse it be
violently held vp) that it should abide there, but it will
descend till it come to (<i>O</i>) the middle point.</p>

<div align=center class="center">
<img src="images/014diagm.png" width="483" height="452"
 alt="Misplaced Earth" />
</div>
</li>
<li id="chap2_3_1_2">
<p>If the earth stood any where but in the midest we should not
see halfe the heauens aboue vs, as now we alway doe, neither
could there be any &AElig;quinox, neither would the daies and nights
lengthen and shorten in that due order and proportion in all
places of the World as now they doe; againe Eclipses would never
fall out but in one part of the heavens, yea the Sunne and Moone
might be directly opposite one to another and yet no Eclipse
follow, all which are absurd. As for example, let the center of
the World be (<i>O</i>) let the earth stand in (<i>A</i>), a good way
distant from the center, it is manifest that the greater halfe of
the Heauens (<i>CIB</i>) will alwaies be aboue, and the lesser halfe
(<i>CDB</i>) below, which is contrary to experience. Thence also it
followes that the daies and nights will never be equall, for the
Sunne (<i>B</i>) will be alwaies longer aboue the earth whil'st he
moues from (<i>B</i>) to (<i>C</i>) then below, mouing from (<i>C</i>) to (<i>B</i>).
Againe the Sunne (<i>B</i>) may stand iust opposite to the Moone (<i>X</i>)
and yet noe Eclipse follow, the earth which makes the Eclipse,
standing out of the midst.</p>

<img src="images/015diagm.png" width="500" height="484"
 alt="Equal Halves" />
</div>
</li>
<li id="chap2_3_1_3">
<p>The shadowes of all bodies on the earth would not fall in that
orderly vniformity as they now doe: for if the earth stood
towards the East, the shadowes would be shortest before noone, if
toward the west afternoone, if towards the North, the shadowes
would still fall Northward, if towards the South, Southwards, all
which experience shewes to be false. As for example, let the
earth stand Eastwards in (<i>A</i>) the shadow of any body vpon the
earth, as of the body vnder (<i>E</i>) will be shorter in the morning
when the sunne is in (<i>C</i>), then at noone when the sunne is in
(<i>X</i>). If the earth stand Southward in (<i>W</i>) the shaddow of any
body will alwaies fall south, as it doth in the figure (<i>Y</i>) and
(<i>Z</i>.)</p>

<li id="chap2_3_2">
<p><i>The second thing to be proued was that the earth is immouable.</i>
where wee must vnderstand a double motion, Streight, or Circular.
For the first it is cleare that with out supernaturall violence
it cannot bee moued in any streight motion, that is, vpward
downewarde, or toward any side; it cannot bee shoued out of his
place.</p>

<p>For the Second, whether abiding still in his place it may not
moue rounde, the question is disputed, and maintained one both
sides. Some affirme it may, and doth: who thinke there is greater
probabilitie the earth should mooue round once a day, then that
the Heauens should by reason of the incredible swiftnesse of the
heauens motion, scarcs conpetible to any naturall body; and the
more likely Slownesse of the earths mouing. Others deny it
grounding theire opinion vpon Scripture, which affirmes the earth
to stand fast, so as it cannot bee moued; and vpon Sence, because
wee perceaue it not to moue, and lastly vpon reasons drawne from
things hurled vp, and let fall vpon the earth. The arguments on
both sides wil bee more easie to bee vnderstood by the figure
that followes.</p>

<div align=center class="center">
<img src="images/017diagm.png" width="513" height="502"
 alt="Moving Earth" />
</div>

<p>In this figure it is manifest, that the earth in the midest,
cannot moue by any streight motion, vpward towarde (<i>N</i>) or
sideward toward (<i>M</i>) or any other way out of its proper place,
and therefore that opinion of <i>Copernicus</i> and others, that the
earth should moue round once a yeere in such a Circle as (<i>MPR</i>)
is most improbable &amp; vnreasonable. And reiected by the most.</p>

<p>But although it cannot moue streight, it may moue round. For
though it be a marueilous great body of vnconceaueable weight,
yet being equally poised on euery side, there is nothing can
hinder its Circular motion. As in a Globe of Lead, or any other
heauy substance, though it were 40. Fadome in compasse, yet being
set vpon his two Poles, it would easily bee turned round euen
with a touch of ones little finger. And therefore it is concluded
that this circular motion is not impossible. The probabilitie of
it is thus made plaine. The whole circuit of the Heauens, wherein
are the fixed Starrs is reckoned by Astronomers to bee
1017562500. that is a Thousand and seauenteene Millions of miles,
fiue hundred sixty two thousand, and fiue hundred miles. Let this
bee the compasse of the Circle (<i>NMOZ</i>.) So many miles doth the
Heauens moue in one day, till the same point come to the place
from whence it went; as till (<i>N</i>) moue round, and come to (<i>N</i>)
againe. This being the motion of the whole day 24. houres, how
many miles will (<i>N</i>) moue in one houre? it will moue 42398437
and a halfe. i.e. Forty two Millions three hundred ninty eight
thousand, foure hundred thirty seuen miles and an halfe. So many
miles will (<i>N</i>) moue in one houre, from (<i>N</i>) to (<i>M</i>.) A motion
so swift that it is vtterly incredible. Farre more likely it is,
the circuit of the earth (<i>ASXV</i>) being about 24000. i.e. twenty
foure thousand miles more or lesse, it should moue round once a
day. For then one point as (<i>X</i>) should moue in one houre from
(<i>X</i>) to (<i>V</i>) but a thousand miles, which motion although it bee
swifter then any arrow or bullet from a Cannons mouth, yet is it
incomparably slower then that of the Heauens, where so many
Millions are posted ouer in an houre.</p>

<p>Now for the saluing of all the c&aelig;lestiall Ph&aelig;nomena, or
appearances, the truth is the same, if wee suppose the earth to
moue, as if wee beleeue it to stand still. The riseing of the
Sunne and Starres, the motions of all the Planets, will keepe
Correspondence that now. Nor neede wee feare logging, or that
steples and towers would totter downe, for the motion is regular,
and steady without rubbes, and knocks. As if you turne a globe
about, it will goe steadyly, and a fly will set fast vpon it,
though you moue it apace. Besides the whole body the ayre is
carryed about with the whirlinge of the earth, so that the earth
will make noe winde, as it turnes swiftly about; as a wheele
will, if it bee turned apace.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all this, most are of another opinion, that the
earth standeth still without all motion, rest rather befittinge
so heauy and dull a body then motion. The maine reason brought to
establish it is this. Let a stone bee throwne downe out of the
ayre from (<i>W</i>:) if the earth stand still, it is manifest it will
fall vpon (<i>X</i>) iust vnder it; as wee see it doth by common
experience, a stone will fall downe from any height vpon the
place wee aymed at, but let the earth moue, the stone will not
light vpon (<i>X</i>) but some where else as one (<i>S</i>:) for (<i>X</i>) will
bee moued away, and gone to (<i>V</i>.)</p>

<p>So againe let two peices of ordinance that will shoote at equall
distance bee discharged one iust towards the East, the other
towards the West; if the earth moue (as they say it doth) towards
the West, the bullet that is discharged Eastward will fly farther
then that Westward. For by the contrary motion of the earth hee
will gaine ground. But experience hath proued this to bee false,
shewing that the bullets, will both fly at equall distance.</p>

<p>To salue this, answere is made that the earth by its swift motion
carries with it and that steadily not only all bodies resting or
moueing vpon it, but also the whole Sph&aelig;re of Aire (<i>WEQ</i>) with
all things whatsoeuer that are moued in it naturally or
violently, as clouds, birds, stones hurled vp or downe, arrowes,
bullets, and such like things violently shott forth: as may
appeare in the figure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The fourth rule.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap2_4">
<p>The earth, though it bee of exceeding greate quantity being
considered in itselfe, yet being compared to the Heauens,
especially the higher sph&aelig;res, is of noe notable bignes, but may
be accounted as a point or pricke in the middest of the world.</p>

<p>That the earth is noe bigger then a point or pinns head in
comparison of the highest heauens will easily appeare vnto vs, by
these reasons.</p>

<ol id="chap2_4_">
<li id="chap2_4_1">
<p>The starres which are many times bigger then the earth, seeme
yet to vs to bee noe bigger then a greate pinns head, or such
like quantity; therefore much lesse shall the earth appeare to
bee of any sensible magnitude.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap2_4_2">
<p>Wee alwaies beholde halfe the heauens aboue vs, which could not
bee if the earth had any sensible proportion to the heauen.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap2_4_3">
<p>All obseruations of hights and distances of the c&oelig;lestiall
bodies, which are made on the superficies of the earth, are as
exact, and true, as if they were made in the very center of the
earth. Which were impossible, vnlesse the thicknes of the earth
were insensible in regard of the Heauens.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap2_4_4">
<p>All Sunn Dialls which stand on the superficies of the earth,
doe as truely cast the shadowes of the houres, as if they stood
in the Center. As for example.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The starre (<i>S</i>) appeares like a point or pricke to them that
dwell in (<i>A</i>) wherefore the earth (<i>OX</i>) will appeare much lesse
to the sight of him that should behold it from (<i>S</i>), nay it
would not bee seene at all. Againe halfe the Heauens (<i>BFE</i>) are
alwayes seene to
<ins class="fixup" title="Read as 'them'. Ed.">the&#x0303;</ins>
that dwell in (<i>A</i>) wanting some two
minutes, betweene (<i>ED</i>) and (<i>BC</i>) which difference is
alltogether insensible. Againe if wee obserue the height of the
starre (<i>S</i>) aboue the Horizon (<i>BE</i>) it will bee all one namely
(<i>BS</i>) whether wee obserue it in the topp of the earth, in (<i>A</i>)
or in the middle in (<i>O</i>.) For, (<i>A</i>) and (<i>O</i>,) are so little
distant one from another, that (<i>AS</i>,) and (<i>OS</i>) will bee
paralell lines, and bee esteemed but
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'sa'. Ed.">as</ins>
one line. The fourth
reason concerning Dialls, is cleare by the framing and
construction of them: wherein either the lower end of the Cocke
(or Gnomon) whereat all the houre lines meet, or the vpper end
and knobb (as in many Dialls) is supposed to bee the Center of
the earth.</p>

withheld within his bankes by diuine power? whether the deepenes
of the Sea, doth exceede the height of the mountaines? whether
mountaines were before the flood? what is the hight of the
highest hilles? whether Iland, came since the flood? what is the
cause of the Ebbing and flowing of the Sea? what is the original
of springs and riuers? what manner of motion the running of the
riuers is? with such like,
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'whehrof'. Ed.">whereof</ins>
some belong not so properly to
this science of Geography as to others. Wee speake onely a word
or two of the last, &amp; so proceed. The question is whether the
motion of the riuers bee streight, or Circular. The doubts on
both sides will best appeare by a figure first drawne: wherein,
Let (<i>HMO</i>) be the Meridian of <i>Alexandria</i> in <i>&AElig;gipt</i>, or of the
Mouth of <i>Nilus</i> and answerable to the meridian of the Heauens.
Another in the Earth (<i>XBY</i>.) Let (<i>B</i>) bee the mouth of <i>Nilus</i>,
and (<i>C</i>) the fountaine and head of it. Now the mouth of <i>Nilus</i>,
where it runnes into the mediterranian Sea, is placed by
geographers in the 31. degree of the North latitud; &amp; the head of
<i>Nilus</i> where it riseth is placed by <i>Polomeus</i> in 11. degree of
the South latitud, but by latter &amp; more exact geographers in the
14. degree of the Southern latitud, so that the distance betweene
the founts &amp; <i>Ostia</i> i.e. betweene (<i>C</i>) and (<i>B</i>) is 45. degrees
of a great Circle, which after the vsuall account makes 2700. one
eight part of the earths compasse. The qu&aelig;stion now is, whether
the runninge from (<i>C</i>) to (<i>B</i>) runne continually downward in a
streight line; or circularly in a crooked line. If it runne in a
streight line, as is most agreeable to the nature of the water it
must moue either by the line (<i>CEB</i>) or by the line (<i>DB</i>.) By
the line (<i>CEB</i>) it cannot moue: for when it is come to (<i>E</i>,) it
will stand still. Because from (<i>E</i>) to (<i>B</i>) it must moue
vpward, if it moue at all, which is contrary to the nature of
water. If therefore it moue by a streight line it can bee noe
other, but (<i>BD</i>,) and so from (<i>D</i>) to (<i>B</i>) it shall
continually descend; for of all places betweene (<i>D</i>,) &amp; (<i>B</i>)
(<i>B</i>) is the nearest to (<i>A</i>.) But then the fountaine must not
bee in (<i>B</i>) but higher in (<i>D</i>) which semees altogether
improbable or impossible. For first the line (<i>AD</i>) would bee
notably and sent by longer then the line (<i>AB</i>) For the compasse
of the earth being about 24000. Miles, and the semidiameter
(<i>AB</i>,) or (<i>AC</i>) 3828. miles the line (<i>CD</i>,) would bee 1581.
miles, which cannot bee true, if as wee haue proued before, the
earth bee round, and that the highest hills make noe sensible
in&aelig;quality. Againe they that dwell in (<i>D</i>) should see the North
Pole starre (<i>N</i>) as well as they that dwell in (<i>B</i>,) which also
is false. So then the riuer cannot runne either by (<i>EB</i>) or
(<i>DB</i>) Runnes it then circularly by the line (<i>CWB</i>?) This seemes
probable, and the rather because heereby a reason of the
originall of Riuers might more easily bee giuen. For the
fountaines (<i>C</i>) lying euen with the superficies of the Sea, the
water may easily passe through the hollowes of the earth, and
breake out at (<i>C</i>) without ascendinge. But here also are some
difficulties: for first wee find by experience that the
fountaines of most riuers, and those greate ons too, lye sensibly
higher then the plaine surface of the Sea. Againe, if the riuer
moue directly round, what should bee the cause that begins and
continues this motion? It is a motion besides the nature of the
water, and therefore violent, what should driue it forward from
the Sea to (<i>C</i>,) and from (<i>C</i>) to (<i>B</i>,) when the water is at
(<i>C</i>) or (<i>W</i>,) it is as neere to the Center (<i>A</i>) as when it is
at (<i>B</i>,) and therefore it should seeme with more liklyhood it
would stand still; for why should it striue to goe further,
seeing where it is, it is as neare to the Center as whither it
runnes. Or if some violence doe driue it from (<i>C</i>,) towards
(<i>W</i>,) yet (as it is the nature of violent motions) the further
it goes the slower it will runne, till in the end it stand still,
if there bee noe aduantadge of ground to helpe it forward.</p>

<div align=center class="center">
<img src="images/025diagm.png" width="524" height="473"
 alt="Source of the Nile" />
</div>

<p>As a bowle throwne downe a hill runnes easily and farre, if it
once bee sett a going; but throwne vpon the ice (an euen place)
it will without any lett at last stand still. Answere may bee
made hereunto, that although there bee noe aduantage of the
ground, yet the water will still moue forwarde from (<i>C</i>) to
(<i>B</i>) because the water that followes, pusheth forwarde that,
that runnes afore. Which answere will stand, when a good cause
may bee shewed, which forcibly driueth the water from the Sea
vnto (<i>C</i>) and out of the fountaine (<i>C</i>;) considering that
(after this supposition) they lie both in the same circular
superficies. Wherefore seeing, wee cannot without any
inconueniency suppose it to moue by any of these lines either
streight as (<i>BC</i>) or (<i>BD</i>,) or circular as (<i>BWC</i>) let vs
enquire farther.</p>

<p>The most likely opinion is, that the motion of the water is mixt
neither directly streight, or circular, but partly one, partly
the other. Or if it be circular, it is in a circle whose center
is a little distant from the Center of the whole globe. Let vs
place fountaines then neither in (<i>C</i>) nor (<i>D</i>) but in (<i>F</i>) I
say the water runnes either partly streight by the (<i>FS</i>) and
partly circular, from (<i>S</i>) to (<i>B</i>) which motion will not be
inconuenient, for the water descending continually from (<i>F</i>) to
(<i>S</i>) will cause it still to runne forward; or else wholy
circular in the circle (<i>FXB</i>.) And this is most agreeable to
truth. For so it shall both runne round as it must doe if wee
will escape the otherwise vnauoidable inconueniences of the first
opinion and yet in running still descend, and come neerer to the
Center, as is most befitting the nature of water, so that wee
need not seeke for any violent cause that moues it. Let vs then
see what is the hight of (<i>F</i>) the fountaines of <i>Nilus</i>, aboue
(<i>C</i>) that is (<i>B</i>) the mouth or outlet of it into the Sea. The
vsuall allowance in watercourses is one foot in descent for 200.
foot in running, but if this bee thought to much because water
will runne awaie vpon any inequality of ground, for euery 500.
foote allow one for descent, &amp; so much we may with reason, in
regard of the swiftnes of many riuers, yea the most, which in
many places runnes headlong, in all places very swiftly
(especially <i>Nilus</i> whose cateracts or downfalls are notable)
which cannot bee without some notable decliuity of the ground.
Thus then the whole course of <i>Nilus</i> being 2700. miles from
(<i>F</i>) to (<i>B</i>) the perpendicular or plumb descent of it (<i>CF</i>)
will be 5. miles. And so high shall the fountaine stand aboue the
mouth, and the surface of the plaine Land (for riuers commonly
arise at foot of hills) which is (<i>BXF</i>) swell vp aboue the
surface of the Sea (<i>BWC</i>) or (<i>BY</i>) which hight of the Land
aboue the Sea
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'althought'. Ed.">although</ins>
it bee greater then is the height of the highest
<ins class="fixup" title="Read as 'mountaines'. Ed.">mou&#x0303;taines</ins>
aboue the plaine Land, yet it is nothing in
comparison of the whole Earth. And this being granted (as with
most probabilitie of reason it may) it will appeare that God in
the beginning of the world imposed noe perpetuall violence vpon
nature, in gathering togeather, the waters into one place, and
being so gathered in keeping them from runing backe to cover the
earth. At the first so soone as those hollow channells were
prepared, the water did naturally slide downe into them, and out
of them without miraculous power they cannot returne. For if the
sea (<i>BY</i>) should overflow the land towards (<i>F</i>) the water must
ascend in running from (<i>B</i>) to (<i>F</i>) which is contrary to its
nature. Certainly the midland countries, whence springs of great
rivers vsually arise, doe ly so high, that the sea cannot
naturally overflow them. For as for that opinion that the water
of the sea in the middle lies on a heape higher then the water
that is by the shore; and so that it is a harder matter to saile
out of a Haven to seaward, then to come in (because they goe
vpward): this is an empty speculation contray to experience, and
the grounds of nature it selfe, as might easily be shewed. All
the difficulty that is in this opinion, is to giue a reason how
the waters mount vp to (<i>F</i>,) and whence the water comes that
should flow out of so high a place of the earth, wherein I thinke
as in many other secrets of nature we must content our selues
with ignorance, seeing so many vaine conjectures haue taken no
better successe.</p>

be any circles truly drawen vpon the earth, yet because there is
a good ground in nature and reason of things for them, we must
imagine them to be drawen vpon the earth, as truly as we see them
described vpon a Globe or in a plaine paper. Further this must be
noted, that all circles on the earth haue the like opposite vnto

the Sunne downe to the South, and so round vnder the earth vp
againe to the North Pole. Another vpon the surface of the earth
passing through your feete just vnder the Sunne, and so
compassing the earth round till it meete at your feete againe,
and these are Meridians answering one to another. Now the
Meridian is not one only, as was the &AElig;quinoctiall, but many still
varying according to the place wherein you are, as for example.
At <i>London</i> there is one Meridian, at <i>Oxford</i> another, at
<i>Bristow</i> another, &amp; so along Eastward or Westward. For it is
noone at <i>London</i> sooner then at <i>Oxford</i>, and at <i>Oxford</i> sooner
then at <i>Bristow</i>. Vpon the globe there are many drawen, all
which passe through the poles, and goe North and South, but there
is one more remarkeable then the rest, drawen broad with small
divisions, which runneth through the Canary Ilands, or through
the Ilands of <i>Azores</i> Westward of <i>Spaine</i>, which is counted the
first Meridian in regard of reckoning and measuring of distances
of places one from another; for otherwise there is neither first
nor last in the round earth. But some place must bee appointed
where to beginne the account and those Ilands haue beene thought
fittest, because no part of the World that lay westward was
knowne to the Ancients further then that: and as they began to
reckon there, we follow them. This circle is called in greeke

limits or bounds to your sight, beyond which nothing can bee
seene vpon the earth. This is greater or lesser, according as the
height of the eye aboue the plaine superficies of the earth, is
more or lesse. The most exact triall hereof is at Sea, where
there are no mountaines nor any vnequall risings of the water to
hinder the sight, as there are at land. For example let (<i>CBAF</i>)
be the superficies of the Sea and let a mans eye bee placed in
(<i>X</i>) aboue the Sea; as the eye stands higher or lower so will
the distance seene be more or lesse, <span class="sidenote"><span

20 foote high (<i>BA</i>) will bee fiue miles, if 40 foote 7 miles, if
50 foote 8 miles. So that from the mast of a ship 50 foote
high, a man may see round about at sea 8 miles every way, toward
(<i>BG</i>) and (<i>F</i>). So farre may the water it selfe be seene, but
any high thing on the Water may be seene farther, 16, or 20 miles
according as the height is, as the ship at (<i>C</i>) may be seene
from (<i>X</i>) as far more as it is from (<i>A</i>) to (<i>B</i>). There can be

<ins class="fixup" title="Read as 'common'. Ed.">co&#x0303;mon</ins>
vse then Globes, it will be needfull to
shew how all these circles, which are drawne most naturally vpon
a round Globe, may also as truly, and profitably for knowledge
and vse be described vpon a plaine paper. Whereby we shall
vnderstand the reason of those lines which We see in the vsuall
Mapps of the world, both how they are drawne, and wherefore they
serue. Vnderstand therefore, that in laying downe the globe vpon
a plaine paper, you must imagine the globe to be cut in two
halfes through the midst, and so to be pressed downe flat to the
paper; as if you should take a hollow dish, and with your hand
squieze the bottom down, till it lie flat vpon a bord, or any
other plaine thing for then will those circles that before were
of equall distance, runne closer together towards the midst.
After this conceit, vniversall Maps are made of two fashions,
according as the globe may be devided two waies, either cutting
quite through by the meridian from North to South, as if you
should cut an apple by the eye and the stalke, or cutting it
through the &AElig;quinoctiall, East and West, as one would divide an
apple through the midst, betweene the eye &amp; the stalke. The
former makes two faces, or hemispheares, the East and the West
hemispheare. The latter makes likewise two Hemispheares, the
North and the South. Both suppositions are good, and befitting
the nature of the globe: for as touching such vniversall maps,
wherein the world is represented not in two round faces, but all
in one square plot, <span class="sidenote"><span class="noshow">[Sidenote:
</span>Of this Hypothesis see <i>Wrights</i> errors of

the ground wherevpon such descriptions are
founded, is lesse naturall and agreeable to the globe, for it
supposeth the earth to be like a Cylinder (or role of bowling
allies) which imagination, vnlesse it be well qualified, is
vtterly false, and makes all such mappes faulty in the
scituation of places. Wherefore omitting this, we will shew the
description of the two former only, both which are easie to be

<h4><i>Of divers Distinctions, and Divisions of the earth.</i></h4>
<br />
</div>
<br />
<p>Next after the Circles of the Earth, wee may not vnfitly handle
the seuerall Divisions and distinctions which geographers make of
the parts, and inhabitants of the earth. These are many, but wee
will briefely runne them ouer.</p>

<ol id="chap5_">
<li id="chap5_1">
<p>The first and most plaine is by the Coasts of the Heauens, and
rising, and Setting of the Sunne, so it is distinguished into the</p>
<ul id="chap5_1_">
<li id="chap5_1_1">
<p>East where the Sunne ariseth. <i>Oreins</i>, <i>Ortus</i>
<i>&alpha;&nu;&alpha;&tau;&omicron;&lambda;&eta;</i>.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap5_1_2">
<p>West where the Sunne goeth downe. <i>occidens</i>.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap5_1_3">
<p>North: betweene both fromwards the Sunne at Noone. <i>Septentrio</i>.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap5_1_4">
<p>South: betweene both towards the Sun at Noone. <i>Meridies</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>These foure are called the cheife or Cardinall quarters of the
world. They with the others betweene them are easily knowne but
are of more vse to Mariners then to vs. Wee may rather take
notice of those other names which by Astronomers Geographers
Divines and Poets are giuen vnto them. Who sometime call the East
the right hand part of the world, sometime the West, sometime the
North, &amp; sometime South, the diuersity is noted in these verses,</p>
<blockquote>
<i>Ad Boream terr&aelig;, Sed Coeli mensor ad Austrum,</i>
<br />
<i>Pr&aelig;co Dei exortum videt, occasumque Poeta.</i>
</blockquote>
That is
<blockquote>
Geographers looke to the North, Astronomers to the South.
<br />
Priests turne them to the East, &amp; Poets to the West.
</blockquote>
<p>This serues for vnderstanding of Authors, wherein any mention is
made of the right or left part of the World, if for example he be
a poet, he means the South by the right hand, the North by the
left: because a poet turnes his face to the West, and so reckons
the quarters of Heauen and Earth.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap5_2">
<p>The second distinction is by the notable differences of heat
and cold, that are observed on the earth, this is the division of
the Earth by Zones or Girdles, which are parts of the Earth,
wherin heat and cold doe remarkably increase or decrease. Those
Zones are 5.</p>

<ol id="chap5_2_">
<li id="chap5_2_1">
<p>The hot or burning Zone (<i>Zona torrida</i>) which containes all
that space of earth, that lieth betwtene the two
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'Torpicks'. Ed.">Tropicks</ins>,
supposed heretofore (but falsly as after experience hath shewed)
to be inhabitable by reason of heat, the Sunne continually lying
ouer some part of it.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap5_2_2">
</li>
<li id="chap5_2_3">
<p>The temperate Zones wherein neither heat nor cold is extreame
but moderate: these are two, one on the North side of the
Aequator, betweene the Articke circle, and the
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'Torpicke'. Ed.">Tropicke</ins>
of
Cancer, another on the South side betweene the
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'Torpicke'. Ed.">Tropicke</ins>
of
Capricorne, and the Antarcticke circle.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap5_2_4">
</li>
<li id="chap5_2_5">
<p>The cold, or Frozen Zones, wherein cold for the most part is
greater then the heat, these likewise are two, one in the North,
betweene the Articke circle, and the North Pole, another on the
South betweene the Antarctick circle and the South Pole. These of
all parts of the earth are worst inhabited, according as
extremity of cold is alwaies a greater enemy to mans body, then
extremity of heat.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li id="chap5_3">
<p>The third distinction is by the shadowes, which bodies doe cast
vpon the earth, iust at nooneday; for these doe not alwaies fall
one way but diuersly according to their divers scituation vpon
the Earth. Now in respect of the shadowes of mens bodies, the
inhabitants of the earth are divided into the</p>

<ol id="chap5_3_">
<li id="chap5_3_1">
<p><i>Amphiscy</i> (&alpha;&mu;&phi;&iota;&sigma;&chi;&iota;&omicron;&iota;)
whose shadow at noone day
fall both waie, so to the North when the Sunne is Southward of
them, &amp; to the South when the Sunne is Northward, and such are
those people that doe dwell in the hot Zone. For the Sunne goes
ouer their heads twice a yeare, once Northward, another time
Southward, when the Sunne is just ouer their heads they are
called <i>Asoy</i>, &alpha;&sigma;&chi;&iota;&omicron;&iota;,
without shadow.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap5_3_2">
<p><i>Heteroscy</i> ('&epsilon;&tau;&epsilon;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&chi;&iota;&omicron;&iota;)
whose shadowes doe alwaies
fall one way, namely alwaies towards the North, as those that
dwell in the Northerne temperate Zone, or alwaies to the South,
as those that dwell in the Southerne temperate Zone.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap5_3_3">
<p><i>Periscy</i> (&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&chi;&iota;&omicron;&iota;)
whose shadowes goe round about
them, as those people who dwell in the two cold Zones, for as the
Sunne never goes downe to them after he is once vp, but alwaies
round about, so doe their shadowes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li id="chap5_4">
<p>The fourth distinction is by the scituation of the Inhabitants
of the Earth, compared on with another: who are called either.</p>

<ol id="chap5_4_">
<li id="chap5_4_1">
<p>Perioeci
(&pi;&epsilon;&rho;&iota;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&omicron;&iota;)
such as dwell round
about the Earth in one and the same paralell, as for
example vnder the Tropicke of Cancer.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap5_4_2">
<p>Antoeci
(&alpha;&nu;&tau;&omicron;&iota;&chi;&omicron;&iota;)
such as dwell opposite to
the former in another Paralell of the same distance
from the &AElig;quator. As those vnder the Tropicke of
Capricorne.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap5_4_3">
<p>Antipodes
(&alpha;&nu;&tau;&iota;&pi;&omicron;&delta;&epsilon;&sigma;)
who dwell iust vnder vs
theire feete opposite to ours.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li id="chap5_5">
<p>The fifth distinction is of the Length and Breadth of the Earth
and places vpon it: these may bee considered two wayes</p>

<ol id="chap5_5_">

<p>Absolutely, and so the</p>

<p>Comparatiuely: comparinge one places scituation with
another, and so the</p>

<li id="chap5_5_2_1">
<p>Longitud of a place, is the distance of it from the
first Meridian going through the Canary Ilands,

</li>
<li id="chap5_5_2_2">
<p>Latitude of a place, is the distance of it from the
&AElig;quator towards the North or South. Whereby wee know
how farre one Place lies Northward, or Southward of
another.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<p>The Longitude must bee reckoned by the degrees of the &AElig;quator,
the Latitude by the degrees of the Meridian.</p>

<p>For example, in these two H&aelig;misph&aelig;res, the longitude of the whole
earth is from (<i>C</i>) to (<i>A</i>) and (<i>B</i>) in the &AElig;quator. The
latitud is from (<i>N</i>) to (<i>S</i>), and from (<i>Q</i>) to (<i>P</i>) the North
and South poles, and this reckoned in any meridian. The first
meridian is (<i>ANBS</i>) which goes by the Canary Ilands, the
&AElig;quinoctiall is (<i>ABCA</i>). Now I haue a Citty giuen so. (<i>D</i>) I
would know in what longitude and latitude it is. For the
longitude I consider what meridian passeth through it, which is
the meridian (<i>NDS</i>) which crosseth the &AElig;quinoctiall in (<i>I</i>) at
15 degrees, wherefore I say that (<i>D</i>) stands Eastward from the
first Meridian 15 degrees. So I finde that the Citty (<i>E</i>) is 150
degrees Eastward, (<i>G</i>) 195, and (<i>F</i>) 345.</p>

<p>For the Latitude I consider what paralell runnes through (<i>DEG</i>)
or (<i>F</i>) and I finde the 30 to passe by (<i>D</i>) 45 by (<i>E</i>) the 15
by (<i>F</i>) the 45 Southward by (<i>G</i>) and those numbers are the
latitude of the place that are distant from the &AElig;quator, (<i>CAB</i>).</p>

</div>

<p>Concerning the means whereby the longitude of places is found
out, there is scarce any thing that hath troubled Mathematicians
so much as the observation of it. For because no standing marke
can be taken (the Heavens alwaies running about) it must needs
bee difficult. To measure vpon the earth, going alwaies vnder the
same paralell, is a way certain in regard of some few places, but
so troublesome in it selfe, and vnprofitable in regard of other
places that ly out of that paralell, that it may be accounted a
fruitlesse labour. The voyages &amp; accounts of Marriners at Sea,
are so full of casualty &amp; vncertainty by reason of the doubtfull
variation of the compasse, the vnequall violence of windes and
tides, the false making of their sea cards, by which they saile,
and the ignorance of the Masters for the greatest part, as there
can hardly be any assured reckoning made by them. The best means
of observation is by Eclipses of the Sunne &amp; Moone, which in
severall Countries are sooner or later seene, according as one
place lies farther East or farther West from another. But this
also falls out so seldome, and when it happens, is so seldome
obserued, and when it is observed, hath so many difficulties in
the precise and exact observation of it; that wee may Well
account this inquiry after the longitude of places, to be one of
those things whereof wee must be content to be ignorant, &amp; rather
to gesse at it in Grosse, then in vaine to striue for exactnesse,

of Citties, though they many times agree in the latitude, doe yet

The sixth Distinction is by the Length or shortnesse of the Day
in Summer time in seuerall Quarters of the earth. And this
diuision is by Climates
(&chi;&lambda;&iota;&mu;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;)
which are seuerall
spaces of the earth contained betweene two Paralells, in the
which the longest day in Summer excedes that in another Paralell
by halfe an Houre. There is a greate deale of Confusion and
difference betweene the late and ancient Geographers about the
distinction and diuers reckonings of the Climats. It is not
worth the labour to recount theire opinions and Calculations:
thus much is plaine, and easie to bee knowne. There are 24.
Climats in which the Day encreaseth by halfe houres from 12.
houres to 24. There are likewise 6. Climats in which the day
encreaseth by moneths, from one moneth to sixe that is halfe a
yeare. Vnder the Aequator the day is alwayes twelue houres longe,
but as you goe from it towards the Pole, the Day lengthens still
till it comes to a day halfe a yeare long. Now in what degrees
of latitude euery on of these Climats beginne and end, shall
appeare by this table following.</p>

<p>The seaventh and last distinction of the earth is taken from
the scituation of it in respect of the Heavens, and especially
the Sunnes motion. In regard whereof Some parts or inhabitants of
the Earth are said to be or dwell in a Right Spheare, some in a
paralell Spheare, and others in an oblique or crooked Spheare.</p>

<ul id="chap5_7_">
<li id="chap5_7_1">

dwell iust vnder the &AElig;quinoctiall, whose Horizon is paralell to
the Meridians, but cutts the &AElig;quator at right Angles, they dwell
in paralell Spheares, who dwell iust vnder either of the Poles,
whose Horizon is parallell to the &AElig;quator, but cuts all the
Meridians at right Angles: and the latter is sometime called a
Paralell Spheare.</p>

learned Geographers. What is the compasse and depth of the earth.
This may be seene in <i>Hues de vsu Globi, part. 3. cap. 2.</i> and in
<i>Clavius</i> on <i>Sacrobosco</i> with others. They all differ so much
one from another, that there is no certainty in trusting any of
them. The most common and received opinion is that the circuit of
the earth is 21600 miles, reckoning 60 miles for every degree,
and then the depth or Diameter of the Earth shall be 6877 English
miles, containing 5000 foote in a mile.</p>

<p>The means wherby the circuit and Diameter of the earth are found
out are principally two.</p>

<ol id="chap6_1_">
<li id="chap6_1_1">
<p>By measuring North or South, vnder one Meridian some good
quantity of ground, threescore or an hundred miles (or two for
the more certainty) for in those petty observations of small
distances there can be no certaine working. This may be done,
though it be laborious, yet exactly without any sensible error by
a skilfull workeman, plotting it out vpon his paper, with due
heed taken, that hee often rectifie the variation of the needle
(by which he travells) vpon due observation, and that all notable
ascents and descents, with such winding and turning as the
necessity of the way causeth, be reduced to one streight line. By
this means wee shall know how many miles in the Earth answering
to a degree in the Heauens; if exact observation by large
instruments be made to finde the elevation of the pole, in the
first place where wee begin to measure, and the last where wee
make an end.</p>

<p>Besides this way of measuring the circumference of the Earth,
there is none other that hath any certainty of
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'obseratio&#x0303;'. Read as 'observation'. Ed.">observatio&#x0303;</ins>
in
it. That by Eclipses is most vncertain, for a little error in a
few minuts of time (which the observers shall not possibly
avoide) breeds a sensible and fowle error in the distance of the
two places of observation. That of <i>Eratosthenes</i> by the Sunne
beames, and a shadow of a stile or gnomon set vpon the Earth, is
as bad as the other. For both the vncertainty of the calculation
in so small quantity as the shadow and the gnomon must needs
haue, and the difficulty to obserue the true length of the
shadow, as also the false supposition wherevpon it proceeds,
taking those lines for Paralells which are not, doe manifestly
shew the reckoning hereby made to be doubt full and not sure.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap6_1_2">
<p>The second is by measuring the semidiameter of the Earth: For
as the circumference makes knowne the diameter, so doth this the
circumference. This may be done by
<ins class="fixup" title="Was originally 'observttion'. Ed.">observation</ins>
made vpon some
great hill, hard by the sea side. The invention is of <i>Maurolycus
Abbot</i> of <i>Messava</i> in <i>Sicilie</i>, but it hath beene perfitted,
and more exactly performed by a worthy Mathematician <i>Ed. W.</i> who
himselfe made proofe of it. By this art was the semidiameter of
the Earth found out to be 18312621 foote: which allowing 5000
foot to a mile is 3662 &amp; a halfe miles, which doubled is the
whole Diameter 7325 miles. The circuit of the earth shall be
23030 miles, and one degree containes 63-35/36 miles which is
almost 64 miles. Which as it exceeds the ordinary account, so may
wee rest vpon it as more exact then any other.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li id="chap6_2">
<p>The second point concerninge the measuringe of particular
distances of places one from another is thus performed.</p>

<p>First vpon the Globe it is most easie. With a payre of Compasses
take the distance betweene any two places howsoever scituated
vpon the Globe, and apply the distance so taken to the &AElig;quator, &amp;
see how many degrees it takes vp; those degrees turned into miles
shew the distance of the two citties on from another.</p>

<p>Vpon vniuersall mapps theire is a little more difficulty in
finding the distance of places which here must bee considered in
a threefold difference of scituation:</p>

<ol id="chap6_2-">
<li id="chap6_2-1">
<p>Of Latitude only.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap6_2-2">
<p>Of Longitude only.</p>
</li>
<li id="chap6_2-3">
<p>Of Latitude and Longitude together.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<hr width="90%" />

<ol id="chap6_2_">
<li id="chap6_2_1">
<p>If the two places differ only in Latitude, and lie vnder the
same Meridian if the places lie both on one side of the &AElig;quator,
the differences of the latitudes: or the summe of both latitudes
added together, if one place lie North and another South, being
turned into Miles giues the true distance.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap6_2_2">
<p>If the places differ only in Longitude, and lie both vnder one
paralell of latitude the difference of longitude turned into
miles proportionably accordinge to the latitude of the paralell,
giues the true distance.</p>
</li>

<li id="chap6_2_3">
<p>The distance of places differing both in latitude and longitude
may thus bee found out, first let there bee drawne a semicircle
vpon a right diameter noted with (<i>ABCD</i>) whereof (<i>D</i>) shall bee
the Center. The greater this Semi-circle is made, so much the
more easie will bee the operation; because the degrees will bee
larger. Then this Semicircle being drawne, and accordingly
devided, imagine that by the helpe of it, you desire to find out
the distance betwixt London and Ierusalem, which Citties are
knowne to differ both in longitude &amp; latitude. Now, that the true
distance betwixt these two places may be found out, you must
first substract the lesser longitude out of the greater, so shall
you find the differences of their longitudes, which is 47.
degrees. Then reckon that difference
<ins class="fixup" title="Read as 'vpon'. Ed.">vpo&#x0303;</ins>
the Semi-circle,
beginning at (<i>A</i>) &amp; so proceed to (<i>B</i>;) &amp; at the end of that
difference, make a marke with the leter (<i>E</i>) vnto which point by
your ruler, let a right line be drawne from (<i>D</i>) the center of
the Semi circle. This being in this sort performed, let the
lesser latitude be sought out which in 32 degrees, in the fore
said semicircle, beginning your accompt from the point (<i>E</i>) and
so proceede towards (<i>B</i>), and at the end of the lesser latitude
let another point be marked out with the letter (<i>G</i>), from which
point, let there be drawen a perpendicular line which may fall
with right Angles vpon the former line drawen from (<i>D</i>) to
(<i>E</i>), and where it chanceth to fall, there marke out a point
with the letter (<i>H</i>): This being performed let the greater
latitude which is 51 degrees 32 minuts, be sought out in the
semicircle beginning to reckon from (<i>A</i>) towards (<i>B</i>) and at
the end of that latitude set another point signed out by the
letter (<i>I</i>) from whence let there be drawen another
perpendicular line that may fall with right angles vpon the
diameter (<i>AC</i>): &amp; here marke out a point with the letter (<i>K</i>),
this done take with your compasse the distance betwixt (<i>K</i>) and
(<i>H</i>) which distance you must set downe vpon the diameter (<i>AC</i>)
placeing the one foot of your compasse vpon (<i>K</i>) and the other
towards the center (<i>D</i>) and there marke out a point with the
letter (<i>L</i>); then with your compasse take the shorter
perpendicular line (<i>GH</i>,) and apply that widenesse vpon the
longer perpendicular line (<i>IK</i>,) placing the one foote of your
compasse at (<i>I</i>,) which is the bounds of the greater latitude,
and extend the other towards (<i>K</i>), and there make a point at
(<i>M</i>), then with your compasse take the distance betwixt (<i>L</i>)
and (<i>M</i>), and apply the same to the semicircle. Placing the one
foot of your compasse in (<i>A</i>) and the other towards (<i>B</i>), &amp;
there marke out a point with the letter (<i>N</i>), now the number of
degrees comprehended betwixt (<i>A</i>) and (<i>N</i>) will expresse the
true distance of the two places, which will bee found to be 39
degrees: which being multiplied by 60. and so converted into
miles according to the former rules, will produce 2340. which is
the distance of the said places.</p>

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
